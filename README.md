# Duality for Unitary Systems
From the Summer of 2022, I worked on my capstone project under the supervision of Prof. Andreas Heinecke to prove a fundamental result in unitary systems in frames using the duality principle.

## Project Overview
In [this](/Capstone.pdf) project, I proposed methods to adapt a result found in the seminal work by [Han and Larsen](https://www.math.tamu.edu/~larson/HL-memoir.pdf) which proved the equivalence of orthonormal bases and tight frames in the case of unitary systems with a wandering vector. 

The original authors explored properties relating to Von Neumann algebras in order to obtain their proof, however, my suggested methods use a more intuitive approach of the duality principle relating the rows and columns of any matrix representation of an operator.

This work also served as an exposition for the topic of frames and unitary systems such that a reader with a preliminary understanding of basic concepts in mathematics might understand the concepts discussed here, since I felt believed that other introductory material is very dense.

## Further Work
In this paper, I propose that this proof can be shown using a [diagonal argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwNxVpbEVcc&t=1s) and go over the results required in it, however, there is one result, namely regarding the injectivity of a matrix, which is yet to be proven which this relies on. Showing that result would lead to the proposed method becoming a valid proof.

I also proposed other methods which can be explored in order to show the same result.

## Further Reading
I also prepared a [presentation](/CapstonePresentation.pdf) briefing readers on the topic in a more concise manner.
Most of the research in this field can be found on the [site](https://framerc.missouri.edu) for the frame research center of the University of Missouri.
Other resources for frames can be found in textbooks by Ole Christensen or other Linear Algebra textbooks.
